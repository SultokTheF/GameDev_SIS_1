## Requirements

Make sure you have the below requirements before starting:

- [Unity Game Engine](https://unity3d.com)
- Basic knowledge in Unity and C#

## Implementation Notes

The snake doesn't really move. It is based on a spawning pool that creates snake-nodes on the grid depending on the direction that you choose. Other than that, the classic design of the game exists as it is. Enjoy :)

## Target Platform

It's made for windows and 1920x1080 display but can be customized if desired.
